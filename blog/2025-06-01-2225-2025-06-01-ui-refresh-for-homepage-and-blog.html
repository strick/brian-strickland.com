    <h1>UI Refresh: Consistent Styling Across My Site</h1><p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-06-01</p><p>Today I overhauled the design of my personal homepage and blog to give it a cleaner, more professional look. Previously, the homepage had some structure and color, but the blog posts and index page were plain and inconsistent � most were just white with inline styles.</p><p>To fix that, I:</p><ul><li>Created a shared <code>styles.css</code> file to handle all layout, typography, and color settings</li><li>Updated each blog post to reference the shared stylesheet and remove redundant inline styling</li><li>Made sure the blog index and individual posts now feel visually integrated with the main site</li><li>Kept the content minimal and focused, with better spacing and font choices</li></ul><p>Everything now feels like it belongs together � whether you're reading a post, browsing the index, or checking out my portfolio. The code is cleaner too, which means I can move faster on content creation going forward.</p>

<p>This year, I led the transformation of our platform development team at UCF IT by implementing <strong>Agile Development 2.0</strong> using ServiceNow’s Agile module. We moved from a mix of unstructured work requests (incidents, enhancements, catalog changes) to a centralized, story-driven development pipeline — allowing us to better plan, track, and deliver.</p>

<h2>Key Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Standardize work intake using RITMs, enhancements, and incidents as triggers</li>
  <li>Convert all development requests into Stories under a Unified Backlog</li>
  <li>Implement Story Point estimation to support sprint planning and capacity forecasting</li>
  <li>Bring visibility to technical work that previously went unnoticed</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Did</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Created a Unified Backlog tied to epics across team goals (e.g., Deprovisioning, Scoped App Enhancements)</li>
  <li>Mapped intake types to story templates using Flow Designer automation</li>
  <li>Trained the team on writing meaningful acceptance criteria and estimating story points</li>
  <li>Introduced regular backlog grooming and monthly sprint demos</li>
</ol>

<h2>Challenges and Culture Shift</h2>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles was shifting the perception that story tracking was only for performance monitoring. I positioned it as a tool for <strong>team accountability, planning, and visibility</strong> — not micromanagement. It helped us prioritize strategically and align with leadership goals.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Improved transparency across projects and support work</li>
  <li>Allowed us to demonstrate velocity and throughput to stakeholders</li>
  <li>Created a structure for new interns and hires to plug into immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automating intake conversion even further using Catalog Tasks + Flow Designer</li>
  <li>Expanding Agile board usage to adjacent teams</li>
  <li>Using reporting to surface long-term trends and bottlenecks</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this shift to Agile 2.0 inside ServiceNow has laid the groundwork for disciplined yet flexible development — supporting everything from daily ops to large-scale digital transformation projects.</p>

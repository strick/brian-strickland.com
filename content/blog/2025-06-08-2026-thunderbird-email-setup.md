<p>I set up <strong>Thunderbird</strong> on both my Windows workstation and Linux Mint laptop to consolidate and streamline how I manage multiple Gmail accounts and project inboxes.</p>

<h3>What I configured:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unified Inbox across four Gmail accounts</li>
  <li>IMAP setup with OAuth2 or App Passwords for secure access</li>
  <li>Project-specific filters and tags for visibility without moving messages</li>
  <li>Color-coded tags: <code>Finance</code> and <code>Projects</code> stand out in the unified view</li>
  <li>Thunderbird columns customized to show tags in the inbox</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why this works:</h3>
<p>This setup gives me offline access, local backups, and high visibility into project-related or financial emails, all without tab-juggling or account switching. Thunderbird serves as my personal email dashboard while mobile apps (like Outlook and Apple Mail) handle quick replies on the go.</p>

<p>Work email stays on the work laptop, and personal inboxes stay lightweight. This split helps keep focus while ensuring I never miss important alerts or project messages.</p>

<p>Bonus: I skipped installation on my Debian HA machine to keep it clean and focused on automation tasks.</p>

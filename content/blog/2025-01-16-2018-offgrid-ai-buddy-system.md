<p>This was the beginning of my <strong>AI Buddy Survival System</strong> — a fully off-grid, solar-powered AI assistant designed to operate during power outages or off-the-grid situations while remaining completely self-reliant.</p>

<h2>Hardware Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beelink SER5 Pro</strong> – Compact, power-efficient, AMD-powered mini PC</li>
  <li><strong>Jackery Explorer 500</strong> – Battery generator for off-grid power</li>
  <li><strong>Jackery SolarSaga 100W Panel</strong> – Solar input for recharging the generator</li>
  <li><strong>ASUS MB16A portable monitor</strong> – Lightweight, USB-powered secondary display</li>
  <li><strong>Logitech K400 Wireless Keyboard</strong> – Built-in touchpad for full mobility</li>
  <li><strong>Samsung T7 2TB SSD</strong> – External storage for models, logs, and backups</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ubuntu</strong> installed directly on the Beelink (internal 500GB NVMe)</li>
  <li><strong>GPT4All</strong> using <code>llama.cpp</code> – Local language model execution</li>
  <li><strong>Home Assistant</strong> for managing smart devices locally</li>
  <li><strong>Offline tools and scripts</strong> for survival routines, automation, and system checks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Completely local AI — no internet dependency</li>
  <li>Rugged, portable, and modular system design</li>
  <li>Solar-powered daily usage while maintaining charge</li>
  <li>Protective cases for all hardware (screen, PC, accessories)</li>
  <li>Future plans: integrate voice control using a repurposed Echo Dot</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The Jackery manual warned against charging while using high-power devices, so I’ve configured usage patterns accordingly. Ubuntu offered the best balance of support and performance for running both Home Assistant and the AI models locally.</p>

<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>Everything works seamlessly: the Beelink boots quickly into Ubuntu, loads Home Assistant and GPT4All, and runs on solar-supplied Jackery power for hours. I store my keyboard and SSD in an accessory bag and have a hard case for the monitor.</p>

<p>This system now serves as both a smart home controller and offline AI companion, ready for everything from camping trips to natural disaster scenarios — a true digital survivalist setup.</p>

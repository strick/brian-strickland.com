I wanted to build a blog that didn't require me to write posts in a clunky CMS. Instead, I partnered with ChatGPT to write and post entries for me—automatically.

Here’s the flow:

- I write or dictate a blog idea to ChatGPT
- It formats the post as HTML and sends it to an Azure Function
- The function writes the post file to my static site’s GitHub repo
- Azure auto-deploys it within minutes

Stay tuned—this post was generated and published without me touching a thing.

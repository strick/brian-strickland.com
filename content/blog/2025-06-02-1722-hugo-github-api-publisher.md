<p>Today I completed a full conversion of my personal blog from static HTML to <strong>Hugo</strong> and implemented a secure publishing API that pushes posts directly to GitHub in Markdown format.</p><h2>Hugo Migration</h2><p>The site was originally running as a static HTML blog hosted via Azure Static Web Apps. I migrated everything to <code>Hugo</code> to gain templating support, markdown formatting, automatic indexing, and future extensibility (tags, search, etc).</p><ul><li>Configured <code>config.toml</code> for base URL, theme, section layouts</li><li>Created a custom <code>layouts/index.html</code> to display blog post cards</li><li>All posts live under <code>content/blog/*.md</code> and are parsed with front matter</li><li>Removed hardcoded <code>index.html</code> in favor of dynamic generation</li></ul><h2>API-Driven Publishing with GitHub Integration</h2><p>Next, I created an Azure Function that allows me to publish posts securely via a REST API:</p><pre><code>- Endpoint: /api/new-blog-post  - Auth: Validates x-api-key header  - Input: { title, content (HTML), slug?, date? }  - Output: Commits a new .md file to /content/blog/  </code></pre><p>Each post is auto-slugified (or uses a provided slug), timestamped with EST-local time, and written in full Hugo front-matter format. Here’s an example generated filename:</p><pre><code>content/blog/2025-06-02-1432-hugo-github-api-publisher.md</code></pre><h2>GitHub Commit Flow</h2><ol><li>Checks if file exists in repo (to determine SHA)</li><li>Commits new or updated content using GitHub API</li><li>Triggers <code>deploy.yml</code> GitHub Action (optional – turns out my static site auto-deploys anyway)</li></ol><p>I had to debug a few issues here:</p><ul><li>404 errors from GitHub Action dispatch — realized it wasn’t necessary due to static auto-deploy on commit</li><li>Posts with future <code>date:</code> values were excluded by Hugo — fixed by calculating the correct local timestamp</li><li>Markdown not rendering — resolved by properly generating YAML front matter and ensuring .md extension</li></ul><h2>End Result</h2><p>I can now publish a blog post in one step:</p><ol><li>Compose JSON with post title + HTML content</li><li>Call the API via <code>curl</code></li><li>Post appears on the live site within seconds</li></ol><p>No manual commits. No Hugo CLI. No GitHub UI. Just one secure API call and the content is published.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><ul><li>Add image support with GitHub asset uploads</li><li>Implement tags/categories and metadata search</li><li>Archive view, changelog tracking, and taxonomy pages</li><li>Optional AI integration to suggest titles or summarize content</li></ul><p>This is a major step in automating and owning my blog infrastructure end-to-end. From Hugo to GitHub to Azure Functions — the whole pipeline is mine.</p>

title: "UI Refresh: Consistent Styling Across My Site"

Today I overhauled the design of my personal homepage and blog to give it a cleaner, more professional look. Previously, the homepage had some structure and color, but the blog posts and index page were plain and inconsistent — most were just white with inline styles.

To fix that, I:

- Created a shared `styles.css` file to handle all layout, typography, and color settings
- Updated each blog post to reference the shared stylesheet and remove redundant inline styling
- Made sure the blog index and individual posts now feel visually integrated with the main site
- Kept the content minimal and focused, with better spacing and font choices

Everything now feels like it belongs together — whether you're reading a post, browsing the index, or checking out my portfolio. The code is cleaner too, which means I can move faster on content creation going forward.

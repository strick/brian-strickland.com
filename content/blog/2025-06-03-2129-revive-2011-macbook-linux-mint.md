<h2>Why I Did This</h2>
<p>This old 2011 MacBook Air originally belonged to my wife, but over time it became unusable for her day-to-day needs. After buying her a new Dell laptop, I decided to experiment with repurposing the MacBook into a Linux-based travel and utility device — instead of letting it collect dust.</p>

<h2>First Attempt: Linux and Wi-Fi Woes</h2>
<p>Some time back, I tried installing Kali Linux on this same MacBook, hoping to use it as a portable pen testing box. But I ran into a wall almost immediately: the built-in Wi-Fi adapter (Broadcom BCM4360) wasn’t supported out of the box on newer kernels. I spent way too much time troubleshooting, patching drivers, and trying workarounds — and eventually gave up.</p>

<p>That experience made me step back from the idea entirely… until I decided to try Linux Mint XFCE.</p>

<h2>Why Linux Mint XFCE?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lightweight and fast — perfect for older hardware</li>
  <li>Still gets regular security and software updates</li>
  <li>Includes a friendly driver manager (huge bonus)</li>
  <li>Great app support — Firefox, VS Code, VLC, LibreOffice</li>
  <li>Clean, responsive interface with low overhead</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup Experience</h2>
<p>I flashed the Linux Mint ISO to a USB stick using Balena Etcher, booted using the Option key, and launched the live session. As expected, Wi-Fi didn’t work initially — but this time, Mint made it easy. I tethered my phone to get temporary internet, opened Driver Manager, and it immediately identified the Broadcom adapter. I selected the proprietary STA driver (v6.30.223.271-23ubuntu1), rebooted, and Wi-Fi was up and running without a fight.</p>

<h2>What I Can Do Now</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Web browsing, video streaming, and media playback</li>
  <li>Lightweight development and scripting work</li>
  <li>Run Kali Linux in a VM for pen testing on the go</li>
  <li>Work offline with a full suite of local tools</li>
  <li>Fully customize the OS to suit my workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Linux Mint XFCE, this MacBook Air has become more useful than it’s been in years. It boots fast, runs clean, and actually gets updates — something macOS on this device hasn’t seen in a long time. I finally have a reliable, flexible Linux laptop that I can use for testing, travel, and light dev work.</p>

<p>My next goal will be to do the same with a 2014 MacBook Pro I’ll be getting soon — with better specs and a Retina display, it’ll be interesting to see how far I can push that one as a daily-use Linux rig.</p>

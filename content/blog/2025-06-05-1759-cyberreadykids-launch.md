<p>Today, I launched <a href="https://www.cyberreadykids.com" target="_blank">CyberReady Kids</a>, a project I’ve been thinking about for a while.</p>

<p>It’s designed to help parents teach their kids digital safety through hands-on missions, home network projects, and fun cybersecurity challenges — all created by a cybersecurity dad (me) for real families.</p>

<p>Highlights from today’s launch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Registered <strong>cyberreadykids.com</strong> and validated DNS through Azure</li>
  <li>Published a custom landing page with subscriber sign-up via Buttondown</li>
  <li>Set up domain forwarding and SSL for clean, secure access</li>
  <li>Wrote and published a <a href="https://www.cyberreadykids.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">privacy & media policy</a> aligned with best practices for families and creators</li>
  <li>Disabled all email tracking and enabled two-factor authentication to protect subscriber privacy</li>
  <li>Added a “Privacy Tip” to the signup form encouraging alias or relay emails</li>
  <li>Standardized visual layout and branding with clean CSS for both pages</li>
</ul>

<p>The entire project is being built with a privacy-first mindset — no trackers, no data selling, no nonsense. Just real content from one parent to another.</p>

<p>Next up: delivering our first free guide — <strong>“3 Things You Can Do Tonight to Protect Your Kids Online”</strong> — to new subscribers, along with behind-the-scenes testing videos and experiments (yes, with my own kids first).</p>

<p>Check it out, share it with a parent who needs it, or follow along as I grow this into a sustainable educational platform for digital hygiene at home.</p>

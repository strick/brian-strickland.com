As part of improving my automated blog workflow, I added logic to update `index.html` every time a new post is published through the API. Now each post is not only committed to the repo, but also listed on the blog homepage automatically.

I also included a simple “Back to blog” link on every post to make navigation easier.

It’s a small update, but another step toward a fully hands-off publishing pipeline.

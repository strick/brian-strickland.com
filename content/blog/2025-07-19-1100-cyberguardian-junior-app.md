<p>We just launched the MVP of <strong>CyberGuardian Junior</strong> — an interactive tool designed to help kids recognize phishing attempts in a safe, hands-on way. This was part of our July “Digital Stranger Danger” toolkit, and we tested it live with our own kids.</p>

<h2>What the MVP Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A working <strong>phishing simulator quiz</strong> that mimics suspicious messages kids might see online</li>
  <li>Scenarios based on real tactics — fake Robux offers, urgent timers, weird grammar, and emotional manipulation</li>
  <li>Simple scoring and feedback so kids know what they got right (and why)</li>
  <li>Mobile-friendly layout so it works from a parent’s phone during a conversation</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Learned from Testing</h2>
<p>We ran the tool with both of our kids. One immediately flagged a fake site for having grammar issues and a countdown timer — lessons from a past Robux scam stuck with her. The other ignored the first attempt but clicked the second — though he paused and asked an adult first. That moment sparked a discussion about hesitation, influence, and trust.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make it <strong>fun and realistic</strong> — like a scam challenge game, not a lecture</li>
  <li>Keep it short, so parents can run through it in a few minutes</li>
  <li>Use it as a springboard for real conversations at home</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add <strong>SMS-style phishing simulation</strong> so parents can send fake scam texts to their kids</li>
  <li>Track <strong>which tactics kids fall for</strong> to personalize the experience</li>
  <li>Include more scenarios — fake giveaways, fake friends, and app permission traps</li>
  <li>Eventually integrate into a gamified CyberGuardian dashboard with progress tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Kids are getting hit with scams earlier and more frequently. Most safety content is passive — videos, checklists, advice. CyberGuardian Junior is active: it gives kids <strong>firsthand experience</strong> resisting social engineering in a safe environment, with parents as guides.</p>

<p>This MVP is just the beginning, but it already proved the concept: kids <strong>can learn to spot scams</strong> — and actually enjoy it.</p>

description: "How I separated devices for CyberReady Kids to keep work, personal, and open source intelligence activities isolated and secure."

 <p>Tonight I took another step forward in structuring my tech projects with purpose-built devices—this time with a focus on <strong>CyberReady Kids</strong> and a future <strong>off-grid AI buddy system</strong>.</p>

  <h2>CyberReady Kids Device Setup</h2>

  <p>I’ve officially separated my <a href="https://cyberreadykids.com/">CyberReady Kids</a> work from my personal and work devices. Here's what I’m using:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>MacBook Air (2011)</strong> – Reverted to <strong>macOS Big Sur</strong> for better compatibility with creative tools like Canva and browser-based workflows. I use it for social post design, web publishing, and even video screen recordings if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>iPhone 8</strong> – Factory reset, no SIM, no personal Apple ID. It now holds all CyberReady Kids social media apps, keeping things streamlined and distraction-free.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This separation helps me stay organized. When it’s time to work on CyberReady Kids, I can simply grab these two devices and enter a focused zone.</p>

  <h2>TikTok Hiccup</h2>

  <p>I had registered matching handles on all social platforms weeks ago but never logged into TikTok. That inactivity, combined with some failed login attempts, resulted in my account being suspended—and eventually banned.</p>

  <p>I’ve submitted an appeal and am hopeful the original handle will be released in the future. In the meantime, I’m using a backup handle with a <code>1</code> at the end.</p>

  <h2>OSINT Device Prep</h2>

  <p>On a related note, I’m also repurposing an <strong>iPhone 7 Plus</strong> for open source intelligence (OSINT) work. It’s been factory reset, and I’m planning to harden it further with privacy-focused apps and clean networking practices.</p>

  <p>Alongside this phone, I’m prepping a laptop to serve as an OSINT workstation. This system will be as invisible and anonymous as I can make it—a longer process, but essential for research work where identity separation and digital hygiene are key.</p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead: Off-Grid AI Buddy System</h2>

  <p>The bigger vision here is building an <strong>off-grid AI assistant</strong>—a voice-responsive, solar-powered system that doesn’t rely on cloud infrastructure. I’ll be using this same mindset: isolated, purpose-built devices that don’t leak data into my personal or work life.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>There’s something deeply satisfying about giving your projects dedicated environments. No clutter, no confusion, just clean separation—and clear mental space to focus. Whether it's CyberReady Kids, OSINT research, or my AI survival rig, this approach is already paying off.</p>
